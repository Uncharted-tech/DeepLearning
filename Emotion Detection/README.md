# Emotion Detection

Run the **EmotionDetection.ipynb** file to generate your own model and test for emotions with your own custom images and live videos

Inorder to test your images and videos without generating your own model, use the ***emotions_detection_FER_100.h5*** model provided in 
the repository to load and run the code under **"Emotion Recognition From Live video"** title to test live videos

Model weights are also stored under the title ***weights.best.hdf5*** when training the model which can also be used to load the model
